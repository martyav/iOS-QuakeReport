# iOS-QuakeReport
## A Swift/iOS port of Udacity's Quake Report toy project

I am an iOS developer who is currently learning Android. I received a Grow With Google scholarship from Udacity, and am working through various lessons.

The Beginner Android course includes a project displaying information from the United States Geological Survey. You can see my work on the project here: [https://github.com/martyav/ud843-QuakeReport](https://github.com/martyav/ud843-QuakeReport)

Since I want to keep sharp, I've decided to create a version of this project for iOS. I hope it will teach me about the similarities and differences between the two platforms, as well as give me practice in case I have port an app for work.
